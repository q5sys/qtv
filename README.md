# qtv

Sometimes I have a directory with hundreds of text files and I need quickly scan through them to find a certain file.  Opening  each file to check the contents gets old real quick.

Thus the need for a quick text viewer.  Hence the name.

It does exactly what its supposed to do... dont expect it to do anything else. ;)
